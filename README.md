# Gender Decoder for Job Ads

This is a JavaScript implementation of the [Gender Decoder for Job Ads](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/) originally [created](https://github.com/lovedaybrooke/gender-decoder) by Kat Matfield. The website of the original version contains [more information](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/about) about the original motivation to build it. It closely follows the Python Library version that was built [by Richard Pope](https://github.com/Doteveryone/genderdecoder). The tool counts how often certain words occur in a text and makes a verdict based on the observed frequencies.

Because this implementation is in JavaScript, it can run the analysis locally within the browser of the user without the need of sending analyzed texts over the internet. 

An additional feature of this version is that you can edit the word lists, in case you do not agree with the original lists, or want to perform this analysis in a different language than English.
